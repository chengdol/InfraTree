# InfraTree

This project is built on top of Vagrant, to quickly launch local testing virtual machine(s) environment with specific services.
I previously have several github repos map to different vagrant application, now decide to merge them into one repo and add central control for easy use and growing.

Current supported applications:
- Plain CentOS virtual machine
- Jenkins cluster one master and two slave nodes
- Consul cluster
- Vault cluster
- Cassandra
