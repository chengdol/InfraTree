  # I disabled the synced folder as the rocky linux image does not have
  # VirtualBox Guest Additions installed, this shared folder feature is not
  # necessary to run VM.

  # If you enable it, you will see error below when you run "vagrant up":

  # Vagrant was unable to mount VirtualBox shared folders. This is usually
  # because the filesystem "vboxsf" is not available. This filesystem is
  # made available via the VirtualBox Guest Additions and kernel module.
  # Please verify that these guest additions are properly installed in the
  # guest. This is not a bug in Vagrant and is usually caused by a faulty
  # Vagrant box. For context, the command attempted was:

  # mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000,_netdev vagrant /vagrant
  # The error output from the command was:
  # mount: /vagrant: unknown filesystem type 'vboxsf'.
  #       dmesg(1) may have more information after failed mount system call.
